      <article>
<p class="p1">“Jared! I wanna talk to you. Get in here, kid.”</p>
<p class="p1">The boss’s gruﬀ voice fell on Jared’s ears like sandpaper from across the oﬃce, and not solely</p>
<p class="p1">due to the boss’s natural grit. This summons was the call of a man who had something</p>
<p class="p1">important to discuss and around this, oﬃce this was never a good thing. The oldest</p>
<p class="p1">occupation, sales, was competitive from the dawn of man, and here was not the place tradition</p>
<p class="p1">went to die. Here it thrived, a festering wound on the face of humanity that constantly</p>
<p class="p1">distracted and deterred those involved from achieving real, genuine interaction.</p>
<p class="p1">A thirty-three year old man with eternally crooked glasses, indecisive posture and well</p>
<p class="p1">groomed hair was the target of today’s call, to the genuine surprise of those around The Who</p>
<p class="p1">inhabited the same earthly plane. He always seemed to be on time, never rocked the boat, and</p>
<p class="p1">kept his head down in meetings despite earning bragging rights around the oﬃce for</p>
<p class="p1">continuously exceptional sales figures. For the boss to take issue with this meek salesman was</p>
<p class="p1">odd. However, it was of little consequence to his peers - they’d largely forgotten about it</p>
<p class="p1">seconds after Jared rose from his seat, crossed the oﬃce with a stumbling gait and closed the</p>
<p class="p1">boss’ door behind himself.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sir,” he quivered, unable yet to overcome his internal trembling to take a seat, “I’m thirty-three</p>
<p class="p1">years old.”</p>
<p class="p1">The boss was always hard to read. This was a man who one would assume would have had</p>
<p class="p1">some sort of distinguished career in sports - large, muscular to no end, and audibly imposing.</p>
<p class="p1">Every word that left his mouth shook your core with a timber unmatched by any other sales</p>
<p class="p1">manager in the country, most likely the entire world. To an outsider, his physical prowess may</p>
<p class="p1">seem wasted on this tiny oﬃce chair at his equally tiny desk in this oﬃce that he alone could fill</p>
<p class="p1">half of if he stretched, but to an insider, they knew that was exactly what gave him this position</p>
<p class="p1">of power, and what allowed him to excel. His presence intimidated employees and it</p>
<p class="p1">intimidated clients into doing exactly what he wished, and this lead to several prosperous</p>
<p class="p1">quarters under his administration. Truthfully, this man was the pinnacle of human achievement,</p>
<p class="p1">if your idea of human achievement is driving others to wither away while stealing money from</p>
<p class="p1">other people in exchange for things they didn’t need to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Jared was exceedingly observant, and knew all this and more about his boss within a few</p>
<p class="p1">weeks of accepting this job. That had been over five years ago. Jared knew what kind of</p>
<p class="p1">discussion he expected to have with his boss after hearing his name shouted across the oﬃce.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, the giant burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="p1">“Jared!” He bellowed in between laughing fits. “I didn’t expect you to be such a man about it!</p>
<p class="p1">Take a seat; I wanna make this quick, and I refuse to make an oﬀer to somebody like this if</p>
<p class="p1">they’re not even at eye level.”</p>
<p class="p1">It turned out Jared was getting a job oﬀer. Somewhere far away, a town where he knew</p>
<p class="p1">nobody, with a brand new sales team. If he accepted it, has was just one step away from</p>
<p class="p1">becoming a sales manager himself. He could have his own branch one day. Maybe aﬀord a</p>
<p class="p1">gym membership so he could fill out that dress shirt, as the boss so kindly put it.</p>
<p class="p1">“But sir, I... all my...”</p>
<p class="p1">“What? Come on, all your what? What’s in this town that’s tying you down? You do good work</p>
<p class="p1">out there, kid, and this is our chance to show the kind of employee this oﬃce can produce.</p>
<p class="p1">Good for me, good for you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“My friends here would really miss me.”</p>
<p class="p1">The boss became quiet, eyes lowering from Jared’s, and Jared had the impression the boss</p>
<p class="p1">was trying to avoid eye contact for a reason.</p>
<p class="p1">“You can keep in touch with people even from a few states away. Plus, with a new team, I</p>
<p class="p1">mean... You’ll make new friends, kid. I think you really need this opportunity. Consider it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Opportunity was not a word Jared was used to hearing, which is why he didn’t immediately</p>
<p class="p1">decline the boss’ oﬀer. As he closed the door to the small, private oﬃce, he scanned the room</p>
<p class="p1">eagerly for any prying eyes, but didn’t catch any darting away as if to invite further</p>
<p class="p1">conversation. Everyone had forgotten about his meeting with the boss already.</p>
<p class="p1">As Jared went back to work, he thought, certainly somebody would ask him about the</p>
<p class="p1">excitement from around the oﬃce earlier in the da After all, the last time somebody was called</p>
<p class="p1">in like that, it was when Peter from HR was caught stealing company time to build model</p>
<p class="p1">planes in the annex oﬃce spaces. That was everyone’s conversations around the water cooler</p>
<p class="p1">for at least a week - didn’t anyone want to hear about Jared?</p>
<p class="p1">The answer was clear about five minutes after five, when the oﬃce cleared out without even a</p>
<p class="p1">passing glance in Jared’s direction. It was a tough conclusion to come to, but one he probably</p>
<p class="p1">should have come to long ago after years passing without a single, real, legitimate</p>
<p class="p1">conversation occurring between him and any coworkers.</p>
<p class="p1">Nobody in this oﬃce gave a shit about Jared.</p>
<p class="p1">His eyes flooded with involuntary tears as he gathered his belongings for the day in his satchel.</p>
<p class="p1">Before he had the chance to screen his emotions the boss walked out from his desk and</p>
<p class="p1">placed a sympathetic hand on Jared’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="p1">“See, kid, I told ya... You need a break. This new job, a new oﬃce, a new town... You need thi-“</p>
<p class="p1">“When do I start?”</p>
<p class="p1">A relieved smile spread across the boss’ entire body.</p>
<p class="p1">“I can get you outta here by next week. Take the week oﬀ before you go to pack. I’ll be in touch</p>
<p class="p1">with more details.”</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed perfect now, though a few hours earlier it had been the last thing Jared ever thought</p>
<p class="p1">he would do. Relocation pay, increased salary, and a new position of power with an all-new</p>
<p class="p1">team of first time employees to lead in sales under a tenured manager the boss had</p>
<p class="p1">recommended for the position. This was exactly the change Jared needed. Without it, it was</p>
<p class="p1">clear he would die much younger than his parents.</p>
<p class="p1">Jared had readied himself for the move by his third day oﬀ work, but the boss wasn’t able to</p>
<p class="p1">accommodate travel plans any earlier. So he spent the last few days in his old home practicing</p>
<p class="p1">speech to make a good first impression on his new peers. He imagined a thousand diﬀerent</p>
<p class="p1">scenarios; asking the sales team where they all came from, joking with the accounting team</p>
<p class="p1">about who among them was most likely a serial killer based on first impressions, and any other</p>
<p class="p1">social interaction he might have with these new faces. He’d managed to convince himself that</p>
<p class="p1">his first impression at this company five years ago was the reason why today he was so</p>
<p class="p1">friendless. His motivation was a full bottle of champagne sitting alone in his now empty</p>
<p class="p1">kitchen, waiting for something worth celebrating and people to celebrate with. Yes, he was</p>
<p class="p1">moving on to better things. But there was still nobody else around to celebrate it.</p>
<p class="p1">He had completely detached himself by the seventh day and was able to hit the road, no</p>
<p class="p1">qualms about leaving his home behind. Suddenly the road was a thing of the past and he was</p>
<p class="p1">in a hotel paid for by his company, picking out the best shade of blue for his tie the first day in</p>
<p class="p1">the new oﬃce. After his suit was picked out and hung outside his closet, he spent the night</p>
<p class="p1">apartment hunting, but had to give up after about a half hour of slowly loading webpages and</p>
<p class="p1">an overwhelming sense of dread over picking out a place he’d have to be happy with for years</p>
<p class="p1">to come.</p>
<p class="p1">The next morning he arrived early, and as he pulled up to the parking lot he realized he was <i>too</i></p>
<p class="p1">early. Not even the manager was here yet; 7:15. For good measure, he pulled back out of the</p>
<p class="p1">parking lot and parked on the street about half a block west, wearing sunglasses so as to not</p>
<p class="p1">be identified. Unsure of what the new boss drove, he monitored traﬃc with exhausting focus,</p>
<p class="p1">trying to guess when he would arrive. When somebody finally arrived, he made sure to wait</p>
<p class="p1">about three minutes before pulling his car back into the parking lot, only driving when he was</p>
<p class="p1">certain nobody would spot him pulling around from his parking spot across the street. No need</p>
<p class="p1">to make a first impression that embarrassing before even seeing these people face to face.</p>
<p class="p1">The oﬃce building was brand new, a true testament to a budding new architect’s vision of the</p>
<p class="p1">world of sales. Glass walls separated the oﬃces, the only one having blinds being the new</p>
<p class="p1">boss. The new boss was already settled in, and it looked like he was talking to somebody from</p>
<p class="p1">HR. He didn’t get up to show Jared around when he saw him enter, instead, he continued his</p>
<p class="p1">conversation with a familiar fervor, seemingly disregarding Jared’s entrance.</p>
<p class="p1">Conceding the idea of a tour, he found his space easily enough and prepared to greet his</p>
<p class="p1">coworkers.</p>
<p class="p1">About 8:30 was when people began to arrive, shaking hands and exchanging names. Jared sat</p>
<p class="p1">in his oﬃce and watched as they all chose their seats and signed into their new computers.</p>
<p class="p1">Enjoying the atmosphere, he chose to observe a while longer. Everybody was getting along</p>
<p class="p1">well, which put a small, creeping smile on his face. Soon he would leave his oﬃce doors to</p>
<p class="p1">introduce himself as their sales lead, and within days he’d have all their contact information</p>
<p class="p1">and hopefully, plans to spend time as people outside of their work environment.</p>
<p class="p1">But first...</p>
<p class="p1">No, really, what was he waiting for? Nobody else here was wasting time getting to know one</p>
<p class="p1">another, and if he waited much longer nothing would change from his last position. He’d be at</p>
<p class="p1">the bottom all over again, the pariah of the oﬃce, only spoken to when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="p1">He strode out his oﬃce door and closed it behind him. Unfortunately, unused to the fluidity of</p>
<p class="p1">the new hinges, he used too much force doing so and the resulting slam of the door alerted the</p>
<p class="p1">entire oﬃce to his presence at once. This, coupled with the near-cartoonish speed of his gait</p>
<p class="p1">hushed the crowd of new faces. Stammering, he tried to get in a brief introduction.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hi, I-I’m new here. Well, uh, we all are, I guess, haha. My name is your sales lead. No. I am</p>
<p class="p1">your new sales lead, my name is, umm, Jare-“</p>
<p class="p1">Another door flew open across the oﬃce as the new boss emerged from his own quarters,</p>
<p class="p1">booming voice completely drowning out Jared’s.</p>
<p class="p1">“H E L L O ! I’m SO excited to open this new branch with ALLLL of you! Now let’s get down to</p>
<p class="p1">business right away, I wanna lay down some oﬃce ground rules, and then talk about</p>
<p class="p1">responsibility. Let’s all step into our lovely new conference room over here and get going!”</p>
<p class="p1">All eyes were completely removed from Jared, but he couldn’t decide right away if that was a</p>
<p class="p1">good thing. One thing was for sure, and that was that this had been one of the absolute worst</p>
<p class="p1">first impressions possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Ears red, he rushed into the conference room and found a seat in the back where he hoped not</p>
<p class="p1">to be noticed. His body was long and slender and that made it diﬃcult to not stand out, but</p>
<p class="p1">nobody seemed too bothered by his presence at least. Now all that he had to do was survive</p>
<p class="p1">this meeting and he could introduce himself to everybody later, individually. They would see</p>
<p class="p1">that he’s really not all that awkward, he just had a really bad start to his day here - they should</p>
<p class="p1">understand. If the first impression was bad he would make it up with the second. Yes, he</p>
<p class="p1">convinced himself, this was going to be diﬀerent. Just had to make it through this meeting.</p>
<p class="p1">Before long he felt eyes on himself again and lifted his head from his slouched position</p>
<p class="p1">sheepishly to see the new boss and the entire oﬃce gazing in his direction.</p>
<p class="p1">“Jared, I was gonna introduce you to the oﬃce, but I heard you already did that for yourself!</p>
<p class="p1">Ha! Anyways that’s him everybody, he’s your sales leader, so you betcha you can expect him to</p>
<p class="p1">drop by your desk when he notices you’re slacking oﬀ! His job is to make sure you all stay</p>
<p class="p1">motivated as a team. He’s gonna be my enforcer so I can focus on more oﬃce wide issues.</p>
<p class="p1">Should be a good dynamic. We’ll see. Anyways, that’s, uh, him. Direct your sales related</p>
<p class="p1">questions to him later. Moving on, let’s talk water cooler talk...”</p>
<p class="p1">Jared was completely speechless. Everybody’s eyes were oﬀ of him in an instant again, but</p>
<p class="p1">what could he even say now? They knew his name, and now they knew him as the oﬃce</p>
<p class="p1">‘enforcer,’ and nobody would want to have to hear from him again. It was all over for him in this</p>
<p class="p1">new oﬃce in an instant.</p>
<p class="p1">Jared left the meeting in utter defeat, slinking back to his oﬃce to close the door and lower the</p>
<p class="p1">shutters. As expected, nobody approached his oﬃce to introduce themselves, and he didn’t go</p>
<p class="p1">out there to do it himself because the thought of doing something else ridiculous in front of an</p>
<p class="p1">entire oﬃce of people genuinely pushed him closer to ‘accidentally’ getting his tie caught in an</p>
<p class="p1">industrial paper shredder in the warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">The new boss didn’t need anything of Jared the first day, but through the following weeks he</p>
<p class="p1">was given specific assignments that were all the same variation of ‘make sure this person is</p>
<p class="p1">doing this diﬀerently and all of our jobs depend on you fixing this.’ It was somewhat harrowing</p>
<p class="p1">but Jared was at least able to introduce himself personally. The problem was that it was entirely</p>
<p class="p1">forced and everybody knew so; everybody knew they only heard from Jared when they were</p>
<p class="p1">making mistakes. As such, he found himself wholly unable to cultivate even a single</p>
<p class="p1">extracurricular relationship with anybody in the staﬀ.</p>
<p class="p1">Once a week, he held a sales meeting to discuss top performers, their best practices, and</p>
<p class="p1">while he tried to be as engaging as possible, absolutely nobody was engaged, or sometimes</p>
<p class="p1">even conscious. The entire sales staﬀ had simultaneously fallen asleep two weeks ago now,</p>
<p class="p1">which was easy enough to understand, but hurtful nonetheless.</p>
<p class="p1">No luck was to be had with the accounting department, as it turned out they were an extremely</p>
<p class="p1">close knit group of extended cousins and as they informed Jared, they were too busy running</p>
<p class="p1">the numbers all day long for his little visits, which he slowly phased out of after that extremely</p>
<p class="p1">one-sided conversation. When it came to connecting with HR, he had a little more success</p>
<p class="p1">since their rep was often out of the oﬃce and so related to being somewhat of an outsider, but</p>
<p class="p1">he was out frequently enough that it was tough to get to know him beyond any of the small</p>
<p class="p1">details Jared could pick out from monthly conversations.</p>
<p class="p1">Time went on and Jared’s responsibilities grew as much as the distance between himself and</p>
<p class="p1">his coworker’s personal lives. The new boss evidently saw this as an opportunity to tack more</p>
<p class="p1">work and more projects on Jared, which he grew to appreciate. The more work he had to do</p>
<p class="p1">the more he spoke to other people and the less he had to focus on what happened every</p>
<p class="p1">single night after 5 when everybody clocked out and he watched the oﬃce filter out and</p>
<p class="p1">everybody walked out together laughing and shaking hands and making plans and smiling and</p>
<p class="p1">laughing at him and -</p>
<p class="p1">Another file fell on Jared’s desk with more gravity than the rest. The new boss didn’t say a word</p>
<p class="p1">about it as usual and made his quick exit from Jared’s oﬃce, whistling as he high-fived one of</p>
<p class="p1">the salesmen as he walked back to his oﬃce. Jared picked up the file he had just been given</p>
<p class="p1">and found written instructions from the new boss for how the team was to spend their Friday</p>
<p class="p1">evening.</p>
<p class="p2">Jared - I’m leaving the office early today, around 2 o’clock. We need</p>
<p class="p2">to computerize our files - all of them! Keeping sales records in</p>
<p class="p2">physical filing cabinets is extremely last century, and we need to</p>
<p class="p2">bring this company to the next! If everyone stays an hour late they</p>
<p class="p2">can get it done. I’m counting on you to organize this Jared!</p>
<p class="p1">He sunk even deeper into his seat. It was 2 o’clock right now, meaning the new boss hadn’t</p>
<p class="p1">even bothered to give Jared the time to prepare the right words to present this to the team.</p>
<p class="p1">Additionally, this was sure to do numbers for Jared’s reputation as the enforcer. A dark scowl</p>
<p class="p1">spread from Jared’s eyes, and the longer he stared at this memo the farther it sank, eventually</p>
<p class="p1">reaching his lips which were now pursed together in white-hot rage. There was no reason other</p>
<p class="p1">than bad luck that Jared was in this position now with his peers, no reason he should get shit</p>
<p class="p1">on so much at this job and at the last and by everybody he had always known, and as these</p>
<p class="p1">thoughts and a million others raced through his brain in a maelstrom of insecurity he had an</p>
<p class="p1">idea that could change everything.</p>
<p class="p1">He peered through his blinds across the oﬃce to the new boss’ which was fortunately vacant.</p>
<p class="p1">Scanning the room, avoiding eye contact with slightly concerned eyes wondering why he was</p>
<p class="p1">so ardently staring around, he determined the new boss was out of the building. Taking a</p>
<p class="p1">moment to collect himself, straightening his tie and brushing back his hair, he strode out of his</p>
<p class="p1">oﬃce with a cool confidence he quite literally had never displayed before even once in his life.</p>
<p class="p1">Leaving his oﬃce was rare so he naturally drew more and more eyes the farther out he came,</p>
<p class="p1">and by the time he reached the center of the open room he was sure he had everyone’s</p>
<p class="p1">attention.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hello everyone! As you may have noticed our, uhh, fearless leader has stepped out for the</p>
<p class="p1">day, and he gave me a special task to assign the whole oﬃce.” As he expected, this elicited an</p>
<p class="p1">air of general annoyance.</p>
<p class="p1">“He wants us to stay late tonight and digitize all of our records - I know, I know, it’s a lo- it’s a</p>
<p class="p1">shit ton of work. That’s why we’re not doing it. At least not on a Friday night, right?” Suddenly,</p>
<p class="p1">Jared was on the receiving end of... applause. Nothing thunderous, but the guys clapped and</p>
<p class="p1">the ladies cheered. It completely filled Jared’s body for a moment, giving him a sense of</p>
<p class="p1">accomplishment and warmth that he hadn’t ever felt in his life.</p>
<p class="p1">“Now I want everybody to wrap up whatever you’re doing and get outta here, if the boss isn’t</p>
<p class="p1">here why should we be? Let’s all enjoy ourselves tonight people!”</p>
<p class="p1">The oﬃce was empty within minutes. Some people came up to Jared and shook his hand, or</p>
<p class="p1">better yet, pat him on the back. However, as Jared painfully took note, nobody extended the</p>
<p class="p1">invitation to him to meet them at the bar he overheard them speaking about. The plans were for</p>
<p class="p1">later that night, and he thought for sure something like this would at least get one person to</p>
<p class="p1">speak up about it, but that chance died as the last employee walked out of the oﬃce.</p>
<p class="p1">Nothing.</p>
<p class="p1">It all goes to hell, it all goes to hell in the end. This place and its people and places and faces</p>
<p class="p1">and names he'd remember that let him down, it would all go to hell soon, someday more soon</p>
<p class="p1">than perceived by most. This wasn't hell, not yet, and he wasn't going, he couldn't let himself</p>
<p class="p1">go there. No slipping. More focus, more drive, to avoid it.</p>
<p class="p1">Jared found himself across the street from the bar the entire oﬃce had planned to meet at. He</p>
<p class="p1">could see them through the smudgy windows, actual human friends who wanted to be around</p>
<p class="p1">each other. Noticing a sharp pain in the palms of his hands, Jared looked down and found his</p>
<p class="p1">untrimmed nails had dug into his skin a little from clenching his fists too hard.</p>
<p class="p1">Relax, relax, relax, or it'll happen again. You'll end up there again.</p>
<p class="p1">He sat in his car for an hour, getting out to refill the meter every 15 minutes, and every time he</p>
<p class="p1">was startled to be doing so. Why stick around? Why watch what infuriated him to no end? Why</p>
<p class="p1">inflict this much pain inwardly? The pressure was building to nearly insurmountable levels, so</p>
<p class="p1">just as the last hint of orange from a dead sunset faded in orbit around the city, he drove oﬀ</p>
<p class="p1">from the scene.</p>
<p class="p1">This was a desert town, and the outskirts were largely unexplored, at least by Jared. Since</p>
<p class="p1">arriving here 100% of his time was spent at the oﬃce, his hotel room, or the commute in</p>
<p class="p1">between. The city itself was unremarkable, with few sights to be seen and nothing to do</p>
<p class="p1">without anybody to do things with, so he sailed past all of it and directed his car onto a</p>
<p class="p1">highway which lead to the barren dunes and dirt roads that surrounded this place.</p>
<p class="p1">Listening to no music, barely even keeping an eye on the road, Jared drifted alone that night,</p>
<p class="p1">with not even a single passing headlight to give him company. Eventually the highway lost its</p>
<p class="p1">lights, which didn't much matter, but was interesting enough for Jared to remember about this</p>
<p class="p1">place. Later still, he had to roll his windows back up, as the desert dust whipping itself through</p>
<p class="p1">his car and into his skin proved to be too much to handle. And finally, after miles of near-zero</p>
<p class="p1">visual sensory input, he saw a sign. A small, rundown billboard with the lights out and the</p>
<p class="p1">material itself in tatters. It advertised a diner oﬀ the next exit and down the first left, open 24/7.</p>
<p class="p1">including holidays.</p>
<p class="p1">A dull hunger had been growing in his stomach this whole drive - or maybe it came from this</p>
<p class="p1">sign? Either way, it was something new, something diﬀerent, and if it was still open, Jared</p>
<p class="p1">would appreciate the chance to eat at this hour. He found the next exit marker bent nearly in</p>
<p class="p1">half, but pulled oﬀ the road, straight half a mile, took a left around a large hill, and saw what he</p>
<p class="p1">had came to this town for.</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven tonight would be this neon light-gilded diner, red and blue tubes dancing around the</p>
<p class="p1">sharp corners of the roof and swooping around to make big loops around their home, which</p>
<p class="p1">was a lit sign reading</p>
<p class="p2"><b>D E S E R T D U N E S D I N E R</b></p>
<p class="p1">The parking lot was empty but well kept, parking spaces clearly demarcated by freshly painted</p>
<p class="p1">lines. The windows of the diner were exceptionally clean and transparent, and through them he</p>
<p class="p1">could see a woman, all alone, cleaning a table with reverence. She didn't react to Jared's car</p>
<p class="p1">sputtering into its parking spot, just kept scrubbing away with intense focus and a distant look</p>
<p class="p1">in her eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">Opening the door set oﬀ a bell that made her look up from her work, and her expression was</p>
<p class="p1">pure elation. It was clear this place hadn't seen a visitor in a long time, but just how long Jared</p>
<p class="p1">couldn't guess.</p>
<p class="p1">She greeted him like an old friend, seated him in the cleanest, most well lit booth and gave him</p>
<p class="p1">a menu straight away. Her clothes were freshly washed and smelled like perfume, the whites in</p>
<p class="p1">her striped blouse were as dazzling as the teeth in her bright smile and her eyes refused to</p>
<p class="p1">break contact with Jared's as she asked him what he'd like to drink.</p>
<p class="p1">A coﬀee, he managed to get out, worried he'd be caught stuttering.</p>
<p class="p1">Cream and sugar?</p>
<p class="p1">Yes.</p>
<p class="p1">I'll have it right out for you, sir, right away.</p>
<p class="p1">She disappeared into the kitchen where Jared could see she was obviously preparing his drink</p>
<p class="p1">herself. There didn't seem to be another soul in this diner; he planned to ask her about that</p>
<p class="p1">when she returned. A monsoon of questions flooded his mind, like how long this place had</p>
<p class="p1">been around for, who was the owner, why was nobody else here, but none of them made it out</p>
<p class="p1">of his mouth before or after she returned, because when she returned, she returned with a kiss.</p>
<p class="p1">Unexpected, passionate, confusing, consuming, Jared couldn't react in any other manner than</p>
<p class="p1">to return her embrace. Before long his mind was completely lost to the throes of passion,</p>
<p class="p1">cramped in their booth and warm from the desert air blowing in from the open kitchen window</p>
<p class="p1">and across their bare backs. This was like nothing Jared had experienced with a woman</p>
<p class="p1">before, remembering the few sexual interactions he'd had in his lifetime.</p>
<p class="p1">He left that night, completely dumbstruck, with a promise to return to her every weekend at her</p>
<p class="p1">request. She promised there would be no other guests when he was there, briefly explaining</p>
<p class="p1">that the weekends in the desert weren't good for business. Seeing no reason to question this</p>
<p class="p1">simple fact, he agreed to come see her again, and again, and again.</p>
<p class="p1">She was all he would think about that weekend. He flirted with the idea of visiting her the</p>
<p class="p1">following night, but remembered she had said she preferred to see him on Fridays. That was</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">e</span>nough to keep him away in the hopes of not ruining this new connection. Instead, he sat in his</p>
<p class="p1">hotel room and returned to the apartment hunt. He could aﬀord a much bigger place than</p>
<p class="p1">before, especially since he was selling the house from back home. The realtor said they’d be</p>
<p class="p1">making a 150% turnover on the property his parents had left behind as his inheritance - it</p>
<p class="p1">would be enough money to live oﬀ of for awhile. However, even the luxury apartments in this</p>
<p class="p1">town were fairly small, so he settled that night on touring a 1,000 square foot apartment about</p>
<p class="p1">30 minutes from his oﬃce. He booked a tour for the following day and went to sleep with a</p>
<p class="p1">smile on his face for the first time in months.</p>
<p class="p1">He found himself knocking on the door to what would soon be his new apartment at noon the</p>
<p class="p1">next day. When he shook the hand of the woman who greeted him, his grip and vigor clearly</p>
<p class="p1">threw her oﬀ rhythm, but Jared kept his swagger, waltzing in past her and circling around</p>
<p class="p1">slowly as he examined the lighting fixtures, the furnished kitchen, the hard wood floors and</p>
<p class="p1">newly renovated bathrooms. It was perfect - plenty of space for one man to spread out. And</p>
<p class="p1">who knew? Maybe if things go well with this new woman...</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll take it!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Very good, sir, but there’s an application, we need to do a background check, and I’ll need</p>
<p class="p1">proof of employment as well -“</p>
<p class="p1">“A what?”</p>
<p class="p1">The realtor was visibly confused as he interrupted her.</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s what?</p>
<p class="p1">Jared’s expression turned sour for just a brief moment before he realized another person could</p>
<p class="p1">see it, and he tried to brighten his smile and shine his teeth before awkwardly choking out his</p>
<p class="p1">next question.</p>
<p class="p1">“A, uhh, background check?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, it’s standard practice in this city - I understand you’re new. All new renters are subject to</p>
<p class="p1">background checks - we can’t deny you living space based on what we find, but it’s necessary</p>
<p class="p1">to find individuals who may not report themselves properly as sexual predators.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh. Understood.”</p>
<p class="p1">There was no risk here - Jared had no criminal record. Still, the idea sent a shiver down his</p>
<p class="p1">spine. This background check - could they dig further than paper, into his heart, and see what</p>
<p class="p1">lies beyond?</p>
<p class="p1">That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p class="p1">“What is?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Uh - sorry, excuse me, I was just talking to myself. That’s fine, perfectly fine. I’ll fill out</p>
<p class="p1">whatever paperwork you need, I just, uhh, have to go for now. I’m tired of the hotel I’m stuck in</p>
<p class="p1">so I just want to get a move on. Here’s my email...”</p>
<p class="p1">After exchanging further intact information he practically staggered out of the property, down</p>
<p class="p1">all 4 flights of stairs to his level and rushed it to his car. Unsure of why he felt so uneasy, he</p>
<p class="p1">knew leaving would ease the anxiety he now felt.</p>
<p class="p1">Jared went to his oﬃce to get a start on digitizing records - he figured if he stayed all night and</p>
<p class="p1">all day Sunday he could finish the task on his own and the new boss would never suspect a</p>
<p class="p1">thing.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a backbreaking weekend, and come Monday it was back to business as usual. No warm</p>
<p class="p1">welcome from his coworkers as they filed into the oﬃce. The new boss, as Jared hoped, left</p>
<p class="p1">him well enough alone. He had managed to finish digitizing every single paper record, and filled</p>
<p class="p1">an extra oﬃce with all the old, outdated paper copies, awaiting their fate of shredding.</p>
<p class="p1">Something had to change and it had to change soon. Even with the weekend promise of his</p>
<p class="p1">new aﬀair, if this isolation continued in his work life, Jared knew it would all become too</p>
<p class="p1">unbearable. Come lunchtime, his blood was ice as he slowly approached a group of three</p>
<p class="p1">coworkers with an empty seat next to one of them. There was nobody else eating here, and he</p>
<p class="p1">would normally just go sit at another table to avoid getting in the way. But today he knew a</p>
<p class="p1">change had to be made and it was abundantly clear that other people were not going to be the</p>
<p class="p1">ones to change things. Practically limping over to their table now, he maned to squeak out</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you guys mind if I, uhh, eat lunch with you?”</p>
<p class="p1">They all turned at once to look at him.</p>
<p class="p1">Oh no, oh god, he thought. I just interrupted them. They’re going to tell everyone how strange</p>
<p class="p1">I’m being right now - how strange I’ve always been to them. Why did I try to make things</p>
<p class="p1">better?</p>
<p class="p1">“Sure, Jared! Everyone was wondering when you’d stone up and start hanging out with us!”</p>
<p class="p1">A woman named Jenny was the first to speak up, and flashed a beaming smile at him</p>
<p class="p1">afterwards</p>
<p class="p1">Oh, what relief! The ice was gone and a radiating warmth was here, and suddenly Jared</p>
<p class="p1">realized how silly he had been throughout this whole aﬀair. Everything he imagined others saw</p>
<p class="p1">within were just his own insecurities being reflected - nobody ever truly hated him. By the end</p>
<p class="p1">of a very pleasant hour he had learned Jenny has two dogs, both Great Danes, Mark was going</p>
<p class="p1">through his third divorce with some model in her 20’s and Jason was trying to get an oﬃce</p>
<p class="p1">softball league started. There were a few other oﬃces in town who he had gotten support from,</p>
<p class="p1">and if he wanted to, Jared could still sign up before they brought the petition to the new boss.</p>
<p class="p1">With newfound camaraderie, days and weeks flew by. Every Friday night he was with his girl,</p>
<p class="p1">and on the occasional weekend he would go out to some bars in town with his coworkers.</p>
<p class="p1">Being included was so very strange, but it was a new experiment he welcomed. By the time he</p>
<p class="p1">found himself making plans for dinner with his neighbors, he barely even remembered having</p>
<p class="p1">to move into his new apartment. It was as if life had just been accelerated by some divine</p>
<p class="p1">force, each moment lasting just long enough to leave a good memory, with little to no hardship</p>
<p class="p1">in between events. Now that work life had all but few stressors removed, and his love life was a</p>
<p class="p1">literal dream, Jared had no reason to complain.</p>
<p class="p1">Do you love me?</p>
<p class="p1">Huh? I’m sorry, what?</p>
<p class="p1">He found himself facing the woman of his dreams - disheveled hair, uniform mostly</p>
<p class="p1">unbuttoned, eyes wide open and staring back at his.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">J</span>ared had been here every Friday night for the past year now, and every encounter was the</p>
<p class="p1">same. He’d arrive around 6, order a coﬀee, and the two of them would make love until their</p>
<p class="p1">bodies gave out. When he felt hunger, he’d bid her adieu for the night and go home to make</p>
<p class="p1">some cheap frozen meal to tide himself over until the next day, when life returned to normal. He</p>
<p class="p1">had never considered how he felt until this moment, when she asked him so tenderly, if he</p>
<p class="p1">loved her.</p>
<p class="p1">I think I do, my dear.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s very good, darling. I think I need to meet your friends.</p>
<p class="p1">Friends? Yes, I think I’ll bring them by sometime soon.</p>
<p class="p1">She was tied to her work, so they agreed he would bring some people by sometime soon. He</p>
<p class="p1">kissed her goodbye and went home that night and hoped that maybe some coworkers at some</p>
<p class="p1">point would take up his suggestion to get dinner at his all-time favorite diner.</p>
<p class="p1">A twinge of sadness did hit him, occasionally, when he thought of writing home to tell his old</p>
<p class="p1">friends and his family about how great things were going for him, but this wasn’t an option he</p>
<p class="p1">had the luxury of partaking in. The past was not a place Jared could survive delving into.</p>
<p class="p1">This whirlwind of reminiscence for the present was interrupted by the sound of his doorbell</p>
<p class="p1">ringing - the neighbors! They had arrived, he knew, and he was reflecting for far too long to</p>
<p class="p1">remember to defrost the chicken or start early on the ingredients. He had invited his neighbor</p>
<p class="p1">and their wife over for dinner, as he learned the young couple had just recently returned from</p>
<p class="p1">their honeymoon. Not knowing them well enough to oﬀer an expensive gift, he presumed this</p>
<p class="p1">would have been a good way to booth introduce himself in a more concrete way, and form</p>
<p class="p1">even more new friendships.</p>
<p class="p1">They were understanding of his forgetfulness, and aftertastes they came in, the young husband</p>
<p class="p1">suggested they go out for dinner instead.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes!” Jared piped up. “I know just the place. This little diner outside of town... The food is</p>
<p class="p1">incredible.”</p>
<p class="p1">Or at least, he really hoped so. These past several months Jared had never tasted a single dish</p>
<p class="p1">other than coﬀee made by his lover - they were always alone, and always both too eager to</p>
<p class="p1">engage physically for Jared to ever try a single dish her diner oﬀered. Afterwards, though, when</p>
<p class="p1">they lied together, sweaty and sticking to the vinyl booths, she would always sing high praises</p>
<p class="p1">of their menu - 24/7 breakfast, lunch or dinner with dishes from every cultural corner of the</p>
<p class="p1">world.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sounds great - we can take your car?”</p>
<p class="p1">The young wife was gorgeous - the husband as well, if Jared was being honest. He could feel</p>
<p class="p1">her smile pulling up the corners of Jared’s own lips. And so, he obliged.</p>
<p class="p1">Jared’s car was old, but had plenty of space in the backseat. The newlyweds were obviously</p>
<p class="p1">trying to be polite, but Jared caught them on multiple occasions sneaking kisses and touches</p>
<p class="p1">and just generally being in love. This didn’t bother him too much; after all, they would likely</p>
<p class="p1">soon be eating at a table where he himself had very recently been with a woman.</p>
<p class="p1">Would she be upset he was bringing company on a Saturday night? He had mentioned his</p>
<p class="p1">dinner plans the previous night, and the waitress beauty had said she wished she could be</p>
<p class="p1">there, but Saturdays were big nights for them, and so she would have to sit this one out. She</p>
<p class="p1">would have no idea Jared would be returning with company...</p>
<p class="p1">He put the thought out of his head as he pulled oﬀ the exit to reach the diner when he saw the</p>
<p class="p1">familiar flashing of lights from multiple police cruisers. Hoping it was unrelated to his plans, he</p>
<p class="p1">pressed on towards the diner, the young couple in his backseat hardly seeming to mind as they</p>
<p class="p1">now found it diﬃcult to pry their lips from one another’s.</p>
<p class="p1">Soon enough, though, he reached a police barricade blocking the parking lot to his heaven.</p>
<p class="p1">Nothing else was right, either. The bright neon tubes were all dim now, no electric hum, with</p>
<p class="p1">visible cracks, illuminated by police floodlights. The painted lines of the parking lot were faded</p>
<p class="p1">and torn up, bumpers in pieces, the chrome finish on the building tarnished. The once pristine</p>
<p class="p1">glass windows were filthy, almost impossible to see through - and some were shattered.</p>
<p class="p1">“Wha-what’s going on? Why did you bring us to a crime scene, dude? What is this place -“ A loud knock on Jared’s window interrupted the unfortunate young man. It was a police oﬃcer</p>
<p class="p1">who noticed their car pulling up to the barricade. He pointed two fingers down, signaling Jared</p>
<p class="p1">to roll the window down, which he did.</p>
<p class="p1">“What brings you, uhh, fine folks out here tonight? Surely you see we’re holding an</p>
<p class="p1">investigation here - we’d appreciate some privacy from the press, if that’s what you are. This</p>
<p class="p1">one is, well, it’s grisly. For the sake fo the victim’s families, take your cameras an-“</p>
<p class="p1">Jared’s voice was cool as steel as he interrupted the oﬃcer, making direct eye contact; no</p>
<p class="p1">blinking.</p>
<p class="p1">“Excuse me, oﬃcer, but we’re not press. I was bringing my friends here to my girlfriend’s diner,</p>
<p class="p1">and I have to say I’m shocked by what I’m seeing. Why, I was just here last night for a little</p>
<p class="p1">coﬀee. Can you tell me what’s happened?”</p>
<p class="p1">The oﬃcers’ expression was inscrutable for a moment while he analyzed what Jared had just</p>
<p class="p1">said.</p>
<p class="p1">“You came to this diner, last night? Buddy, you have the wrong exit or something. It’s been shut</p>
<p class="p1">down for months. We’re here investigating a murder - this place is pretty remote, so we just</p>
<p class="p1">discovered the body, but - and you didn’t hear this from me - the worst part is we’ve found the</p>
<p class="p1">victim has been sexually violated. Very recently. It’s a goddamned mess in there if I’m being</p>
<p class="p1">honest. Now, since you fine folks just pulled up, and you’re claiming to have been here</p>
<p class="p1">recently, I’d be remiss if I didn’t invite all three of you fine folks down to our station for some</p>
<p class="p1">questioning. I’m only going to ask now.”</p>
<p class="p1">The gaze the two shared could ignite steel wool. Did he clock Jared that easily, this quickly?</p>
<p class="p1">It was dark outside the car, but he could see the oﬃcer’s right hand was on his hip, likely over a</p>
<p class="p1">holster. Jared couldn’t hide his now-sour expression crawling out from the pleasant smile he</p>
<p class="p1">had tried so hard to maintain now for so long. Not just tonight, but the past few weeks,</p>
<p class="p1">months, years.</p>
<p class="p1">This is what happens, this is what happens when you try. You reach out, you connect, they do</p>
<p class="p1">background checks, they invite you out to drinks, they spend hours reading your expression to find out the real you, and it takes one fuck up to unravel the whole person you’ve built to</p>
<p class="p1">protect yourself here. Nothing can fix this but to leave again.</p>
<p class="p1">Tears welled in Jared’s eyes as he slowly moved his hands down the edge of his steering</p>
<p class="p1">wheel, so excruciatingly slowly. The oﬃcer’s face had grown dark as well, and the silence of</p>
<p class="p1">that night ensured Jared could hear even the man’s subtle muscular flexing as he readied his</p>
<p class="p1">hand to reach for his weapon. The two in the backseat were practically struggling to breathe as</p>
<p class="p1">they shivered violently in fear. Everyone here was connecting the dots.</p>
<p class="p1">His hands reached the bottom of the steering wheel, slender fingers gripping the smooth</p>
<p class="p1">handle of a small pistol kept discreetly in a groove between his steering wheel and the</p>
<p class="p1">dashboard. There was only one way out of all of this, and it wouldn't be easy. But he had done</p>
<p class="p1">it again. And he refused to be killed.</p>
<p class="p1">Screams erupted from the backseat as he quickly raised his arm and fired with a shout, the</p>
<p class="p1">metal knocking back against his hand, a gesture of unhappiness, a loud crack of rage and</p>
<p class="p1">isolation that would once again brand his heart.</p>
