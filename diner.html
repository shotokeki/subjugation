<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Jared! I wanna talk to you. Get in here, kid.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The boss’s gruﬀ voice fell on Jared’s ears like sandpaper from across the oﬃce, and not solely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">due to the boss’s natural grit. This summons was the call of a man who had something</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">important to discuss and around this, oﬃce this was never a good thing. The oldest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">occupation, sales, was competitive from the dawn of man, and here was not the place tradition</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">went to die. Here it thrived, a festering wound on the face of humanity that constantly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">distracted and deterred those involved from achieving real, genuine interaction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A thirty-three year old man with eternally crooked glasses, indecisive posture and well</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">groomed hair was the target of today’s call, to the genuine surprise of those around The Who</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">inhabited the same earthly plane. He always seemed to be on time, never rocked the boat, and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">kept his head down in meetings despite earning bragging rights around the oﬃce for</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">continuously exceptional sales figures. For the boss to take issue with this meek salesman was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">odd. However, it was of little consequence to his peers - they’d largely forgotten about it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">seconds after Jared rose from his seat, crossed the oﬃce with a stumbling gait and closed the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">boss’ door behind himself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Sir,” he quivered, unable yet to overcome his internal trembling to take a seat, “I’m thirty-three</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">years old.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The boss was always hard to read. This was a man who one would assume would have had</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">some sort of distinguished career in sports - large, muscular to no end, and audibly imposing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every word that left his mouth shook your core with a timber unmatched by any other sales</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">manager in the country, most likely the entire world. To an outsider, his physical prowess may</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">seem wasted on this tiny oﬃce chair at his equally tiny desk in this oﬃce that he alone could fill</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">half of if he stretched, but to an insider, they knew that was exactly what gave him this position</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">of power, and what allowed him to excel. His presence intimidated employees and it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">intimidated clients into doing exactly what he wished, and this lead to several prosperous</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">quarters under his administration. Truthfully, this man was the pinnacle of human achievement,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">if your idea of human achievement is driving others to wither away while stealing money from</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">other people in exchange for things they didn’t need to purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared was exceedingly observant, and knew all this and more about his boss within a few</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">weeks of accepting this job. That had been over five years ago. Jared knew what kind of</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">discussion he expected to have with his boss after hearing his name shouted across the oﬃce.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Instead, the giant burst into laughter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Jared!” He bellowed in between laughing fits. “I didn’t expect you to be such a man about it!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Take a seat; I wanna make this quick, and I refuse to make an oﬀer to somebody like this if</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">they’re not even at eye level.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It turned out Jared was getting a job oﬀer. Somewhere far away, a town where he knew</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">nobody, with a brand new sales team. If he accepted it, has was just one step away from</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">becoming a sales manager himself. He could have his own branch one day. Maybe aﬀord a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">gym membership so he could fill out that dress shirt, as the boss so kindly put it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“But sir, I... all my...”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“What? Come on, all your what? What’s in this town that’s tying you down? You do good work</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">out there, kid, and this is our chance to show the kind of employee this oﬃce can produce.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Good for me, good for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“My friends here would really miss me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The boss became quiet, eyes lowering from Jared’s, and Jared had the impression the boss</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">was trying to avoid eye contact for a reason.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You can keep in touch with people even from a few states away. Plus, with a new team, I</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">mean... You’ll make new friends, kid. I think you really need this opportunity. Consider it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Opportunity was not a word Jared was used to hearing, which is why he didn’t immediately</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">decline the boss’ oﬀer. As he closed the door to the small, private oﬃce, he scanned the room</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">eagerly for any prying eyes, but didn’t catch any darting away as if to invite further</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">conversation. Everyone had forgotten about his meeting with the boss already.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As Jared went back to work, he thought, certainly somebody would ask him about the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">excitement from around the oﬃce earlier in the da After all, the last time somebody was called</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">in like that, it was when Peter from HR was caught stealing company time to build model</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">planes in the annex oﬃce spaces. That was everyone’s conversations around the water cooler</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">for at least a week - didn’t anyone want to hear about Jared?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The answer was clear about five minutes after five, when the oﬃce cleared out without even a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">passing glance in Jared’s direction. It was a tough conclusion to come to, but one he probably</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">should have come to long ago after years passing without a single, real, legitimate</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">conversation occurring between him and any coworkers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nobody in this oﬃce gave a shit about Jared.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His eyes flooded with involuntary tears as he gathered his belongings for the day in his satchel.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before he had the chance to screen his emotions the boss walked out from his desk and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">placed a sympathetic hand on Jared’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“See, kid, I told ya... You need a break. This new job, a new oﬃce, a new town... You need thi-“</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“When do I start?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A relieved smile spread across the boss’ entire body.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I can get you outta here by next week. Take the week oﬀ before you go to pack. I’ll be in touch</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">with more details.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It seemed perfect now, though a few hours earlier it had been the last thing Jared ever thought</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">he would do. Relocation pay, increased salary, and a new position of power with an all-new</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">team of first time employees to lead in sales under a tenured manager the boss had</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">recommended for the position. This was exactly the change Jared needed. Without it, it was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">clear he would die much younger than his parents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared had readied himself for the move by his third day oﬀ work, but the boss wasn’t able to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">accommodate travel plans any earlier. So he spent the last few days in his old home practicing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">speech to make a good first impression on his new peers. He imagined a thousand diﬀerent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">scenarios; asking the sales team where they all came from, joking with the accounting team</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">about who among them was most likely a serial killer based on first impressions, and any other</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">social interaction he might have with these new faces. He’d managed to convince himself that</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">his first impression at this company five years ago was the reason why today he was so</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">friendless. His motivation was a full bottle of champagne sitting alone in his now empty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">kitchen, waiting for something worth celebrating and people to celebrate with. Yes, he was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">moving on to better things. But there was still nobody else around to celebrate it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He had completely detached himself by the seventh day and was able to hit the road, no</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">qualms about leaving his home behind. Suddenly the road was a thing of the past and he was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">in a hotel paid for by his company, picking out the best shade of blue for his tie the first day in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the new oﬃce. After his suit was picked out and hung outside his closet, he spent the night</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">apartment hunting, but had to give up after about a half hour of slowly loading webpages and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">an overwhelming sense of dread over picking out a place he’d have to be happy with for years</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to come.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The next morning he arrived early, and as he pulled up to the parking lot he realized he was too</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">early. Not even the manager was here yet; 7:15. For good measure, he pulled back out of the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">parking lot and parked on the street about half a block west, wearing sunglasses so as to not</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">be identified. Unsure of what the new boss drove, he monitored traﬃc with exhausting focus,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">trying to guess when he would arrive. When somebody finally arrived, he made sure to wait</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">about three minutes before pulling his car back into the parking lot, only driving when he was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">certain nobody would spot him pulling around from his parking spot across the street. No need</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to make a first impression that embarrassing before even seeing these people face to face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The oﬃce building was brand new, a true testament to a budding new architect’s vision of the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">world of sales. Glass walls separated the oﬃces, the only one having blinds being the new</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">boss. The new boss was already settled in, and it looked like he was talking to somebody from</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">HR. He didn’t get up to show Jared around when he saw him enter, instead, he continued his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">conversation with a familiar fervor, seemingly disregarding Jared’s entrance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Conceding the idea of a tour, he found his space easily enough and prepared to greet his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">coworkers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">About 8:30 was when people began to arrive, shaking hands and exchanging names. Jared sat</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">in his oﬃce and watched as they all chose their seats and signed into their new computers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Enjoying the atmosphere, he chose to observe a while longer. Everybody was getting along</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">well, which put a small, creeping smile on his face. Soon he would leave his oﬃce doors to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">introduce himself as their sales lead, and within days he’d have all their contact information</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and hopefully, plans to spend time as people outside of their work environment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But first...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">No, really, what was he waiting for? Nobody else here was wasting time getting to know one</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">another, and if he waited much longer nothing would change from his last position. He’d be at</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the bottom all over again, the pariah of the oﬃce, only spoken to when absolutely necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He strode out his oﬃce door and closed it behind him. Unfortunately, unused to the fluidity of</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the new hinges, he used too much force doing so and the resulting slam of the door alerted the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">entire oﬃce to his presence at once. This, coupled with the near-cartoonish speed of his gait</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">hushed the crowd of new faces. Stammering, he tried to get in a brief introduction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Hi, I-I’m new here. Well, uh, we all are, I guess, haha. My name is your sales lead. No. I am</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">your new sales lead, my name is, umm, Jare-“</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Another door flew open across the oﬃce as the new boss emerged from his own quarters,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">booming voice completely drowning out Jared’s.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“H E L L O ! I’m SO excited to open this new branch with ALLLL of you! Now let’s get down to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">business right away, I wanna lay down some oﬃce ground rules, and then talk about</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">responsibility. Let’s all step into our lovely new conference room over here and get going!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All eyes were completely removed from Jared, but he couldn’t decide right away if that was a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">good thing. One thing was for sure, and that was that this had been one of the absolute worst</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">first impressions possible.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ears red, he rushed into the conference room and found a seat in the back where he hoped not</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to be noticed. His body was long and slender and that made it diﬃcult to not stand out, but</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">nobody seemed too bothered by his presence at least. Now all that he had to do was survive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">this meeting and he could introduce himself to everybody later, individually. They would see</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">that he’s really not all that awkward, he just had a really bad start to his day here - they should</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">understand. If the first impression was bad he would make it up with the second. Yes, he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">convinced himself, this was going to be diﬀerent. Just had to make it through this meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before long he felt eyes on himself again and lifted his head from his slouched position</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">sheepishly to see the new boss and the entire oﬃce gazing in his direction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Jared, I was gonna introduce you to the oﬃce, but I heard you already did that for yourself!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ha! Anyways that’s him everybody, he’s your sales leader, so you betcha you can expect him to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">drop by your desk when he notices you’re slacking oﬀ! His job is to make sure you all stay</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">motivated as a team. He’s gonna be my enforcer so I can focus on more oﬃce wide issues.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Should be a good dynamic. We’ll see. Anyways, that’s, uh, him. Direct your sales related</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">questions to him later. Moving on, let’s talk water cooler talk...”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared was completely speechless. Everybody’s eyes were oﬀ of him in an instant again, but</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">what could he even say now? They knew his name, and now they knew him as the oﬃce</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘enforcer,’ and nobody would want to have to hear from him again. It was all over for him in this</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">new oﬃce in an instant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared left the meeting in utter defeat, slinking back to his oﬃce to close the door and lower the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">shutters. As expected, nobody approached his oﬃce to introduce themselves, and he didn’t go</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">out there to do it himself because the thought of doing something else ridiculous in front of an</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">entire oﬃce of people genuinely pushed him closer to ‘accidentally’ getting his tie caught in an</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">industrial paper shredder in the warehouse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The new boss didn’t need anything of Jared the first day, but through the following weeks he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">was given specific assignments that were all the same variation of ‘make sure this person is</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">doing this diﬀerently and all of our jobs depend on you fixing this.’ It was somewhat harrowing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">but Jared was at least able to introduce himself personally. The problem was that it was entirely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">forced and everybody knew so; everybody knew they only heard from Jared when they were</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">making mistakes. As such, he found himself wholly unable to cultivate even a single</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">extracurricular relationship with anybody in the staﬀ.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once a week, he held a sales meeting to discuss top performers, their best practices, and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">while he tried to be as engaging as possible, absolutely nobody was engaged, or sometimes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">even conscious. The entire sales staﬀ had simultaneously fallen asleep two weeks ago now,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">which was easy enough to understand, but hurtful nonetheless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">No luck was to be had with the accounting department, as it turned out they were an extremely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">close knit group of extended cousins and as they informed Jared, they were too busy running</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the numbers all day long for his little visits, which he slowly phased out of after that extremely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">one-sided conversation. When it came to connecting with HR, he had a little more success</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">since their rep was often out of the oﬃce and so related to being somewhat of an outsider, but</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">he was out frequently enough that it was tough to get to know him beyond any of the small</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">details Jared could pick out from monthly conversations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Time went on and Jared’s responsibilities grew as much as the distance between himself and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">his coworker’s personal lives. The new boss evidently saw this as an opportunity to tack more</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">work and more projects on Jared, which he grew to appreciate. The more work he had to do</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the more he spoke to other people and the less he had to focus on what happened every</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">single night after 5 when everybody clocked out and he watched the oﬃce filter out and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">everybody walked out together laughing and shaking hands and making plans and smiling and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">laughing at him and -</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Another file fell on Jared’s desk with more gravity than the rest. The new boss didn’t say a word</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">about it as usual and made his quick exit from Jared’s oﬃce, whistling as he high-fived one of</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the salesmen as he walked back to his oﬃce. Jared picked up the file he had just been given</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and found written instructions from the new boss for how the team was to spend their Friday</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">evening.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared - I’m leaving the office early today, around 2 o’clock. We need</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to computerize our files - all of them! Keeping sales records in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">physical filing cabinets is extremely last century, and we need to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">bring this company to the next! If everyone stays an hour late they</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">can get it done. I’m counting on you to organize this Jared!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He sunk even deeper into his seat. It was 2 o’clock right now, meaning the new boss hadn’t</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">even bothered to give Jared the time to prepare the right words to present this to the team.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Additionally, this was sure to do numbers for Jared’s reputation as the enforcer. A dark scowl</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">spread from Jared’s eyes, and the longer he stared at this memo the farther it sank, eventually</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">reaching his lips which were now pursed together in white-hot rage. There was no reason other</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">than bad luck that Jared was in this position now with his peers, no reason he should get shit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">on so much at this job and at the last and by everybody he had always known, and as these</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">thoughts and a million others raced through his brain in a maelstrom of insecurity he had an</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">idea that could change everything.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He peered through his blinds across the oﬃce to the new boss’ which was fortunately vacant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Scanning the room, avoiding eye contact with slightly concerned eyes wondering why he was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">so ardently staring around, he determined the new boss was out of the building. Taking a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">moment to collect himself, straightening his tie and brushing back his hair, he strode out of his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">oﬃce with a cool confidence he quite literally had never displayed before even once in his life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Leaving his oﬃce was rare so he naturally drew more and more eyes the farther out he came,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and by the time he reached the center of the open room he was sure he had everyone’s</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">attention.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Hello everyone! As you may have noticed our, uhh, fearless leader has stepped out for the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">day, and he gave me a special task to assign the whole oﬃce.” As he expected, this elicited an</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">air of general annoyance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“He wants us to stay late tonight and digitize all of our records - I know, I know, it’s a lo- it’s a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">shit ton of work. That’s why we’re not doing it. At least not on a Friday night, right?” Suddenly,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared was on the receiving end of... applause. Nothing thunderous, but the guys clapped and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">the ladies cheered. It completely filled Jared’s body for a moment, giving him a sense of</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">accomplishment and warmth that he hadn’t ever felt in his life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Now I want everybody to wrap up whatever you’re doing and get outta here, if the boss isn’t</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">here why should we be? Let’s all enjoy ourselves tonight people!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The oﬃce was empty within minutes. Some people came up to Jared and shook his hand, or</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">better yet, pat him on the back. However, as Jared painfully took note, nobody extended the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">invitation to him to meet them at the bar he overheard them speaking about. The plans were for</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">later that night, and he thought for sure something like this would at least get one person to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">speak up about it, but that chance died as the last employee walked out of the oﬃce.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It all goes to hell, it all goes to hell in the end. This place and its people and places and faces</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and names he'd remember that let him down, it would all go to hell soon, someday more soon</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">than perceived by most. This wasn't hell, not yet, and he wasn't going, he couldn't let himself</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">go there. No slipping. More focus, more drive, to avoid it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared found himself across the street from the bar the entire oﬃce had planned to meet at. He</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">could see them through the smudgy windows, actual human friends who wanted to be around</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">each other. Noticing a sharp pain in the palms of his hands, Jared looked down and found his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">untrimmed nails had dug into his skin a little from clenching his fists too hard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Relax, relax, relax, or it'll happen again. You'll end up there again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He sat in his car for an hour, getting out to refill the meter every 15 minutes, and every time he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">was startled to be doing so. Why stick around? Why watch what infuriated him to no end? Why</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">inflict this much pain inwardly? The pressure was building to nearly insurmountable levels, so</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">just as the last hint of orange from a dead sunset faded in orbit around the city, he drove oﬀ</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">from the scene.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This was a desert town, and the outskirts were largely unexplored, at least by Jared. Since</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">arriving here 100% of his time was spent at the oﬃce, his hotel room, or the commute in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">between. The city itself was unremarkable, with few sights to be seen and nothing to do</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">without anybody to do things with, so he sailed past all of it and directed his car onto a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">highway which lead to the barren dunes and dirt roads that surrounded this place.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Listening to no music, barely even keeping an eye on the road, Jared drifted alone that night,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">with not even a single passing headlight to give him company. Eventually the highway lost its</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">lights, which didn't much matter, but was interesting enough for Jared to remember about this</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">place. Later still, he had to roll his windows back up, as the desert dust whipping itself through</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">his car and into his skin proved to be too much to handle. And finally, after miles of near-zero</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">visual sensory input, he saw a sign. A small, rundown billboard with the lights out and the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">material itself in tatters. It advertised a diner oﬀ the next exit and down the first left, open 24/7.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">including holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A dull hunger had been growing in his stomach this whole drive - or maybe it came from this</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">sign? Either way, it was something new, something diﬀerent, and if it was still open, Jared</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">would appreciate the chance to eat at this hour. He found the next exit marker bent nearly in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">half, but pulled oﬀ the road, straight half a mile, took a left around a large hill, and saw what he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">had came to this town for.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Heaven tonight would be this neon light-gilded diner, red and blue tubes dancing around the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">sharp corners of the roof and swooping around to make big loops around their home, which</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">was a lit sign reading</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">D E S E R T D U N E S D I N E R</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The parking lot was empty but well kept, parking spaces clearly demarcated by freshly painted</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">lines. The windows of the diner were exceptionally clean and transparent, and through them he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">could see a woman, all alone, cleaning a table with reverence. She didn't react to Jared's car</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">sputtering into its parking spot, just kept scrubbing away with intense focus and a distant look</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Opening the door set oﬀ a bell that made her look up from her work, and her expression was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">pure elation. It was clear this place hadn't seen a visitor in a long time, but just how long Jared</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">couldn't guess.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She greeted him like an old friend, seated him in the cleanest, most well lit booth and gave him</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">a menu straight away. Her clothes were freshly washed and smelled like perfume, the whites in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">her striped blouse were as dazzling as the teeth in her bright smile and her eyes refused to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">break contact with Jared's as she asked him what he'd like to drink.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A coﬀee, he managed to get out, worried he'd be caught stuttering.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Cream and sugar?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I'll have it right out for you, sir, right away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She disappeared into the kitchen where Jared could see she was obviously preparing his drink</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">herself. There didn't seem to be another soul in this diner; he planned to ask her about that</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">when she returned. A monsoon of questions flooded his mind, like how long this place had</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">been around for, who was the owner, why was nobody else here, but none of them made it out</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">of his mouth before or after she returned, because when she returned, she returned with a kiss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Unexpected, passionate, confusing, consuming, Jared couldn't react in any other manner than</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to return her embrace. Before long his mind was completely lost to the throes of passion,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">cramped in their booth and warm from the desert air blowing in from the open kitchen window</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and across their bare backs. This was like nothing Jared had experienced with a woman</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">before, remembering the few sexual interactions he'd had in his lifetime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He left that night, completely dumbstruck, with a promise to return to her every weekend at her</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">request. She promised there would be no other guests when he was there, briefly explaining</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">that the weekends in the desert weren't good for business. Seeing no reason to question this</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">simple fact, he agreed to come see her again, and again, and again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She was all he would think about that weekend. He flirted with the idea of visiting her the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">following night, but remembered she had said she preferred to see him on Fridays. That was</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">enough to keep him away in the hopes of not ruining this new connection. Instead, he sat in his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">hotel room and returned to the apartment hunt. He could aﬀord a much bigger place than</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">before, especially since he was selling the house from back home. The realtor said they’d be</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">making a 150% turnover on the property his parents had left behind as his inheritance - it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">would be enough money to live oﬀ of for awhile. However, even the luxury apartments in this</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">town were fairly small, so he settled that night on touring a 1,000 square foot apartment about</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">30 minutes from his oﬃce. He booked a tour for the following day and went to sleep with a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">smile on his face for the first time in months.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He found himself knocking on the door to what would soon be his new apartment at noon the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">next day. When he shook the hand of the woman who greeted him, his grip and vigor clearly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">threw her oﬀ rhythm, but Jared kept his swagger, waltzing in past her and circling around</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">slowly as he examined the lighting fixtures, the furnished kitchen, the hard wood floors and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">newly renovated bathrooms. It was perfect - plenty of space for one man to spread out. And</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">who knew? Maybe if things go well with this new woman...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I’ll take it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Very good, sir, but there’s an application, we need to do a background check, and I’ll need</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">proof of employment as well -“</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“A what?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The realtor was visibly confused as he interrupted her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“What’s what?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared’s expression turned sour for just a brief moment before he realized another person could</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">see it, and he tried to brighten his smile and shine his teeth before awkwardly choking out his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">next question.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“A, uhh, background check?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Yes, it’s standard practice in this city - I understand you’re new. All new renters are subject to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">background checks - we can’t deny you living space based on what we find, but it’s necessary</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to find individuals who may not report themselves properly as sexual predators.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Oh. Understood.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There was no risk here - Jared had no criminal record. Still, the idea sent a shiver down his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">spine. This background check - could they dig further than paper, into his heart, and see what</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">lies beyond?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That’s ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“What is?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Uh - sorry, excuse me, I was just talking to myself. That’s fine, perfectly fine. I’ll fill out</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">whatever paperwork you need, I just, uhh, have to go for now. I’m tired of the hotel I’m stuck in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">so I just want to get a move on. Here’s my email...”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After exchanging further intact information he practically staggered out of the property, down</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">all 4 flights of stairs to his level and rushed it to his car. Unsure of why he felt so uneasy, he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">knew leaving would ease the anxiety he now felt.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared went to his oﬃce to get a start on digitizing records - he figured if he stayed all night and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">all day Sunday he could finish the task on his own and the new boss would never suspect a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">thing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It was a backbreaking weekend, and come Monday it was back to business as usual. No warm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">welcome from his coworkers as they filed into the oﬃce. The new boss, as Jared hoped, left</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">him well enough alone. He had managed to finish digitizing every single paper record, and filled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">an extra oﬃce with all the old, outdated paper copies, awaiting their fate of shredding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Something had to change and it had to change soon. Even with the weekend promise of his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">new aﬀair, if this isolation continued in his work life, Jared knew it would all become too</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">unbearable. Come lunchtime, his blood was ice as he slowly approached a group of three</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">coworkers with an empty seat next to one of them. There was nobody else eating here, and he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">would normally just go sit at another table to avoid getting in the way. But today he knew a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">change had to be made and it was abundantly clear that other people were not going to be the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">ones to change things. Practically limping over to their table now, he maned to squeak out</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Do you guys mind if I, uhh, eat lunch with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They all turned at once to look at him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh no, oh god, he thought. I just interrupted them. They’re going to tell everyone how strange</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’m being right now - how strange I’ve always been to them. Why did I try to make things</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">better?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Sure, Jared! Everyone was wondering when you’d stone up and start hanging out with us!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A woman named Jenny was the first to speak up, and flashed a beaming smile at him</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">afterwards</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh, what relief! The ice was gone and a radiating warmth was here, and suddenly Jared</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">realized how silly he had been throughout this whole aﬀair. Everything he imagined others saw</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">within were just his own insecurities being reflected - nobody ever truly hated him. By the end</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">of a very pleasant hour he had learned Jenny has two dogs, both Great Danes, Mark was going</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">through his third divorce with some model in her 20’s and Jason was trying to get an oﬃce</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">softball league started. There were a few other oﬃces in town who he had gotten support from,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and if he wanted to, Jared could still sign up before they brought the petition to the new boss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With newfound camaraderie, days and weeks flew by. Every Friday night he was with his girl,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and on the occasional weekend he would go out to some bars in town with his coworkers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Being included was so very strange, but it was a new experiment he welcomed. By the time he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">found himself making plans for dinner with his neighbors, he barely even remembered having</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to move into his new apartment. It was as if life had just been accelerated by some divine</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">force, each moment lasting just long enough to leave a good memory, with little to no hardship</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">in between events. Now that work life had all but few stressors removed, and his love life was a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">literal dream, Jared had no reason to complain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do you love me?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Huh? I’m sorry, what?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He found himself facing the woman of his dreams - disheveled hair, uniform mostly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">unbuttoned, eyes wide open and staring back at his.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared had been here every Friday night for the past year now, and every encounter was the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">same. He’d arrive around 6, order a coﬀee, and the two of them would make love until their</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">bodies gave out. When he felt hunger, he’d bid her adieu for the night and go home to make</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">some cheap frozen meal to tide himself over until the next day, when life returned to normal. He</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">had never considered how he felt until this moment, when she asked him so tenderly, if he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">loved her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I think I do, my dear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That’s very good, darling. I think I need to meet your friends.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Friends? Yes, I think I’ll bring them by sometime soon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She was tied to her work, so they agreed he would bring some people by sometime soon. He</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">kissed her goodbye and went home that night and hoped that maybe some coworkers at some</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">point would take up his suggestion to get dinner at his all-time favorite diner.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A twinge of sadness did hit him, occasionally, when he thought of writing home to tell his old</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">friends and his family about how great things were going for him, but this wasn’t an option he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">had the luxury of partaking in. The past was not a place Jared could survive delving into.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This whirlwind of reminiscence for the present was interrupted by the sound of his doorbell</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">ringing - the neighbors! They had arrived, he knew, and he was reflecting for far too long to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">remember to defrost the chicken or start early on the ingredients. He had invited his neighbor</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and their wife over for dinner, as he learned the young couple had just recently returned from</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">their honeymoon. Not knowing them well enough to oﬀer an expensive gift, he presumed this</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">would have been a good way to booth introduce himself in a more concrete way, and form</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">even more new friendships.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They were understanding of his forgetfulness, and aftertastes they came in, the young husband</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">suggested they go out for dinner instead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Yes!” Jared piped up. “I know just the place. This little diner outside of town... The food is</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">incredible.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Or at least, he really hoped so. These past several months Jared had never tasted a single dish</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">other than coﬀee made by his lover - they were always alone, and always both too eager to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">engage physically for Jared to ever try a single dish her diner oﬀered. Afterwards, though, when</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">they lied together, sweaty and sticking to the vinyl booths, she would always sing high praises</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">of their menu - 24/7 breakfast, lunch or dinner with dishes from every cultural corner of the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">world.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Sounds great - we can take your car?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The young wife was gorgeous - the husband as well, if Jared was being honest. He could feel</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">her smile pulling up the corners of Jared’s own lips. And so, he obliged.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared’s car was old, but had plenty of space in the backseat. The newlyweds were obviously</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">trying to be polite, but Jared caught them on multiple occasions sneaking kisses and touches</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and just generally being in love. This didn’t bother him too much; after all, they would likely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">soon be eating at a table where he himself had very recently been with a woman.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Would she be upset he was bringing company on a Saturday night? He had mentioned his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">dinner plans the previous night, and the waitress beauty had said she wished she could be</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">there, but Saturdays were big nights for them, and so she would have to sit this one out. She</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">would have no idea Jared would be returning with company...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He put the thought out of his head as he pulled oﬀ the exit to reach the diner when he saw the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">familiar flashing of lights from multiple police cruisers. Hoping it was unrelated to his plans, he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">pressed on towards the diner, the young couple in his backseat hardly seeming to mind as they</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">now found it diﬃcult to pry their lips from one another’s.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon enough, though, he reached a police barricade blocking the parking lot to his heaven.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nothing else was right, either. The bright neon tubes were all dim now, no electric hum, with</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">visible cracks, illuminated by police floodlights. The painted lines of the parking lot were faded</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and torn up, bumpers in pieces, the chrome finish on the building tarnished. The once pristine</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">glass windows were filthy, almost impossible to see through - and some were shattered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Wha-what’s going on? Why did you bring us to a crime scene, dude? What is this place -“ A loud knock on Jared’s window interrupted the unfortunate young man. It was a police oﬃcer</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">who noticed their car pulling up to the barricade. He pointed two fingers down, signaling Jared</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">to roll the window down, which he did.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“What brings you, uhh, fine folks out here tonight? Surely you see we’re holding an</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">investigation here - we’d appreciate some privacy from the press, if that’s what you are. This</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">one is, well, it’s grisly. For the sake fo the victim’s families, take your cameras an-“</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jared’s voice was cool as steel as he interrupted the oﬃcer, making direct eye contact; no</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">blinking.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Excuse me, oﬃcer, but we’re not press. I was bringing my friends here to my girlfriend’s diner,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">and I have to say I’m shocked by what I’m seeing. Why, I was just here last night for a little</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">coﬀee. Can you tell me what’s happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The oﬃcers’ expression was inscrutable for a moment while he analyzed what Jared had just</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You came to this diner, last night? Buddy, you have the wrong exit or something. It’s been shut</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">down for months. We’re here investigating a murder - this place is pretty remote, so we just</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">discovered the body, but - and you didn’t hear this from me - the worst part is we’ve found the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">victim has been sexually violated. Very recently. It’s a goddamned mess in there if I’m being</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">honest. Now, since you fine folks just pulled up, and you’re claiming to have been here</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">recently, I’d be remiss if I didn’t invite all three of you fine folks down to our station for some</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">questioning. I’m only going to ask now.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The gaze the two shared could ignite steel wool. Did he clock Jared that easily, this quickly?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It was dark outside the car, but he could see the oﬃcer’s right hand was on his hip, likely over a</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">holster. Jared couldn’t hide his now-sour expression crawling out from the pleasant smile he</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">had tried so hard to maintain now for so long. Not just tonight, but the past few weeks,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">months, years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This is what happens, this is what happens when you try. You reach out, you connect, they do</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">background checks, they invite you out to drinks, they spend hours reading your expression to find out the real you, and it takes one fuck up to unravel the whole person you’ve built to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">protect yourself here. Nothing can fix this but to leave again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Tears welled in Jared’s eyes as he slowly moved his hands down the edge of his steering</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">wheel, so excruciatingly slowly. The oﬃcer’s face had grown dark as well, and the silence of</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">that night ensured Jared could hear even the man’s subtle muscular flexing as he readied his</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">hand to reach for his weapon. The two in the backseat were practically struggling to breathe as</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">they shivered violently in fear. Everyone here was connecting the dots.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His hands reached the bottom of the steering wheel, slender fingers gripping the smooth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">handle of a small pistol kept discreetly in a groove between his steering wheel and the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">dashboard. There was only one way out of all of this, and it wouldn't be easy. But he had done</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">it again. And he refused to be killed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Screams erupted from the backseat as he quickly raised his arm and fired with a shout, the</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">metal knocking back against his hand, a gesture of unhappiness, a loud crack of rage and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">isolation that would once again brand his heart.</span></p>
